<h1>New Question</h1>
<%= render "form" %>
<!-- <%# #refactored the below form since it was duplicated with new.html.erb and edit.html.erb.
# the above code render will look for partial names '_form.html.erb' within the same folder as this file. to look at seperate path/folder list full path  %> -->
<%# form_for is a Rails built-in form helper which generates a form that integegrates
    nicely with a matching controller (in this case questions_controller).
    Case 1: if @question is not persisted (not yet saved to the database), then
            form_for will make the form send a `POST` request to `questions_path`
            which should be defined to submit to questions controller / create action.
            Also, if you have any attributes pre-set on any of the @question
            fields (such as title or body). it will be pre-populate those fields.
            One more thing, it will also add a special class if there happens to be
            errors on a specific field.
